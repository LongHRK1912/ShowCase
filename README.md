### About
**Chat With Myself** is a private, emotional time-capsule journaling app.  
You write a message today → choose to receive it back after 1, 3, 7, or 30 days → on that day, it returns as if your “Past You” just sent it.

It’s not just a diary — it’s a real conversation with yourself across time.

---

### How It Works
1. Write anything to yourself right now
2. Pick a delay: 1 day • 3 days • 7 days • 30 days
3. When the time comes → notification + message from “Past You”
4. Read, feel, reply — keep the dialogue with yourself alive
