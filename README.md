### About
**Chat With Myself** is a deeply personal time-capsule journaling app.  
You send a message to yourself today → choose 1, 3, 7 or 30 days → on that exact day, it comes back as if “Past You” just texted you.

It’s not just a diary. It’s a real, emotional conversation with yourself across time.
