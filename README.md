### About
**Chat With Myself** is a private time-capsule journaling app that lets you have real conversations with your past and future self.

You write a message today → choose when to receive it back (1, 3, 7, or 30 days) → on that exact day, the message returns as if your “Past You” just sent it.  
It’s like a diary — but way more emotional and alive.

### How It Works
1. Write anything to yourself today
2. Pick a delay: 1 day, 3 days, 7 days, or 30 days
3. When the time comes → get a notification + message from “Past You”
4. Read, feel, reply — keep the conversation with yourself going
